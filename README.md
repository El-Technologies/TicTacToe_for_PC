# tictactoe
A GUI TicTacToe project in java
There's a mysterious little bug that makes the whole code go haywire if you reset after a tie so the reset button will be disabled if you end up in a tie
But you can freely reset after you or the computer wins
You'd just have to re-run the project if you end up in a tie.
